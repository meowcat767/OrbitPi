# OrbitPi

Originally written for the UTC Portsmouth "Pi Game Coding Competition".

## How it works

OrbitPi uses jMonkeyEngine3 for all game/rendering code, and uses Kotlin for data storage.
Managers run the game's services (AudioManager runs the audio service, GameSettings runs the settings service, etc).
